# Unreliable weather reports
The company has decided to cut corners and save money on weather stations placed each moons!
## Features
-  Moons can now have an "Unknown" weather, which can be any weather (including no weather),
- The weather reports now have a chance of being incorrect,
- Interferences may cause all moons to have an "Unknown" weather for a day.

## Configs
- Chance of unknown weather per moon (default: 35%),
- Chance of incorrect weather report per moon, if not unknown (default: 20%),
- Chance of unknown weather everywhere for an entire day (default: 10%).

*Please contact me on Discord (matthiewpurple) if you have ideas for more configurations options!*
## Notes
Unfortunately, this mod doesn't technically add a new weather type, but instead simply patches the way they're displayed. Because of that, any mod that already messes with the way the in-game terminal displays the moons list will be incompatible.
